# VocoDaisy


**VocoDaisy** is a port of the original *mda Talkbox* plugin, created by **Paul Kellett** at [Maxim Digital Audio](http://mda.smartelectronix.com/), to the Daisy Seed platform. The original source code was open-sourced to [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mda-vst/) in 2015 and is available at the following [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pluginguru/mda-effects).

This project extracts and refactors the *mda Talkbox* algorithm ‚Äî originally written for VST2 hosts ‚Äî into a standalone C++ class suitable for the [Daisy](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy) audio platform.

The **mda Talkbox** effect is a *Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) vocoder*, similar to the one used in the *Digitech Talker* pedal ‚Äî famously employed by *Daft Punk* for their characteristic robotic vocal sounds.


## Building the Project

### üß∞ What You Need

* [Daisy Toolchain](https://daisy.audio/tutorials/toolchain-windows/) installed and set up.
* [DaisyExamples](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyExamples) repo, which contains examples and, most importantly, the [libDaisy](https://github.com/electro-smith/libDaisy) and [DaisySP](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisySP) libraries, which are needed to build the project. Make sure to put it in the same folder where you cloned the VocoDaisy repo.


### üéõÔ∏è Building for Daisy (Firmware Build)

You can build the firmware version directly in VS Code:

1. Open the VocoDaisy project folder in VS Code.
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + B** to build it with the Daisy toolchain.

If you get errors regarding libDaisy and DaisySP, make sure to have built the libraries at least once. To do so:

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + B**.
2. Select the **Tasks: Run Task** command.
3. Then select the **build_all** task (this will build the libraries contained in the DaisyExamples folder).

For this to work, your VocoDaisy folder and the DaisyExamples one should be in the same directory.


### üíª Building and Running the Desktop Test Version

If you want to try the effect on your computer before flashing it to Daisy, you can build and run the test version:

1. Open a terminal and go to the project root folder.

2. Build the test executable:

   ```bash
   make test
   ```

3. Put your WAV files (the modulator and carrier) inside the `test` folder.

4. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./test
   ```

   If you just run it like that, it‚Äôll automatically use:

   * **mod.wav** ‚Üí modulator input
   * **car.wav** ‚Üí carrier input
   * **out.wav** ‚Üí output file
   * 48 ‚Üí blockSize

   You can also pass your own files and block size if you want:

   ```bash
   ./test <modulator.wav> <carrier.wav> <output.wav> <blockSize>
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   ./test vocals.wav synth.wav vocoded.wav 64
   ```


## Notes

* Make sure your `.wav` files are in the `test` folder before running the executable.
* The test build is just meant for checking the algorithm and doing some quick experiments ‚Äî real-time performance depends on your computer.
